 * This file is used to markup the cart list product item title.
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/xt-woo-floating-cart/parts/cart/list/product/title.php.
 *
 * Available global vars:
 *
 * @var $product WC_Product
 * @var $cart_item
 * @var $cart_item_key
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion we will need to update template files and you (the theme developer).
 * will need to copy the new files to your theme to maintain compatibility. We try to do this.
 * as little as possible, but it does happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will.
 * be bumped and the readme will list any important changes.
